Cluster Flow
============

Cluster Flow is a pipelining tool to automate and standardise bioinformatics analyses on high-performance cluster environments. It is designed to be easy to use, quick to set up and flexible to configure.

## Cluster Flow Website - [http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/)

There's a new website which for the Cluster Flow documentation which has loads of helpful information and examples. You can see it here: [http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/)

If you're anxious to just get your hands on the code, check out the [releases page](https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow/releases)

Change Log
----------
#### v0.4 devel
* Bugs Squashed
	* Fixed output filename problem in tophat with output cleaning
#### [v0.3](https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow/releases/tag/v0.3) - 2014-07-11
* New Stuff
	* Awesome new HTML report e-mails
		* Much more readable HTML report e-mails which look super-snazzy (see [example](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/example_report_good.html))
		* Any errors are highlighted making them quick to identify (see [example](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/example_report_bad.html))
		* Custom strings set in the config can flagged as [highlights](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/example_report_highlights.html) or as [warnings](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/example_report_warnings.html)
		* Designed to work on desktop and mobile phone screens
	* Cluster Flow now re-orders the log file so that output from different modules doesn't overlap
		* Made each module prepend its stdout and sterr with a CF module flag
		* Made the `cf_run_finished` module parse the above flag and print out module by module
	* Rewrote how the environment module loading works - now much more robust
		* Uses `modulecmd` to prepare perl syntax commands
		* Moved code into the `load_environment_modules` function in Helpers.pm
	* Added environment module aliases
		* This allows you to load specific environment module versions or use different names to those specified within CF modules
		* eg. Replace `fastqc` with `FastQC/0.11.2`
* Updates
	* Made the `bismark_methXtract` module create genome-wide coverage reports if GTF path is available
	* Added the `-q` parameter to the FastQC module to make the log files cleaner
	* Removed the now uneccesary `bismark_tidy` module and renamed `bismark_messy` to `bismark_report`
* Bugs Squashed
	* Fixed dependency bug introduced in v0.2 which was making all downloads fire simultaneously
	* Fixed issue where modules using the CF::Constants Perl Module couldn't load the central config file
	* Fixed typo in environment module loading in `bismark_align` module
	* Reordered loading of the environment modules in `trim_galore` so that FastQC is loaded first, fixing dependency issues
	
#### [v0.2](https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow/releases/tag/v0.2) - 2014-05-29
* New Stuff
	* Now compatable with SLURM
	* Customise batch job commands in the config (see the [docs](http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow/installation/#making_cluster_flow_work_with_your_environment)
	* Created new GitHub pages website to hold documentation: http://ewels.github.io/clusterflow
* Updates
	* Ported repository to github: https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow
	* Wrote new readme for github
* Bugs Squashed
	* Custom modules in `~/clusterflow/modules/` weren't being found
	* General code clean-ups all over the place 

#### [v0.1](https://github.com/ewels/clusterflow/releases/tag/v0.1) - 2014-04-25
* The first public release of Cluster Flow, although it's been in use at the Babraham Institute for around 6 months. It's been in heavy development throughout that time and is now approaching a state of being relatively stable.
